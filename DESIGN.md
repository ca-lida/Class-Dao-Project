I.Introduction

Our project aims to use blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure and efficient platform for voting on climate change funds and initiatives. 

By adopting the ERC-777 token standard and a governance model inspired by Model United Nations and implemented through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), we intend to facilitate global participation and ensure that voting on key issues is handled fairly and without duplication.
